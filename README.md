## Coding Strategy

My coding strategy consisted on taking what I already learned from watching the video and trying to use it to arrange the new elements that I added, such as algae, coral, and sea plants. Once I added all of the elements I started to size them apropietly and then I postioned in especific places. One thing to mention, I notices that the order in which you write the code affects the position of the elements. For example, when i added the orange coral, it was in front of all of the sea plants and algae, I copied the code for the coral and pasted it before the sea plants. This made the sea plants much more visible since they were in front of the orange coral.
