        • delta - how far along we are in the animation

        We refer to these things collectively as the "timing model."

        Applying the timing model to our objects gives us our "animation model" and thus the animation. :-)

        This looks awesome, but it's robotic.

        We can fix this with Easing.

        All easing is, is slowing the delta down or speeding it up in places by using a "timing function."

        A timing function takes a value from 0.0-1.0 and outputs another value (generally) between 0.0 and 1.0

        Here's an awesome website:

            https://easings.net/

        And here are the functions for those easings (note this is in TypeScript – which is JavaScript with a bunch of extended syntax):

            https://github.com/ai/easings.net/blob/master/src/easings/easingsFunctions.ts        

    */

    //Linear, in goes x, out comes x
    Animate.linear = (x) => x;

    //Quadratic
	Animate.easeIn  = (x) => x * x;
    Animate.easeOut = (x) => 1 - (1 - x) * (1 - x);
	Animate.easeInOut = (x) => x < 0.5 ? 2 * x * x : 1 - Math.pow(-2 * x + 2, 2) / 2; //Yay math!

    /*

        And now we can edit our to() above by:
        
         - Adding a new parameter for the easing
         - Adding in a new easing variable that replaces delta for our interpolations

    */


    /*

        And here is one for cubic bezier easing, which you can "plug and play"

            https://cubic-bezier.com/

        The math behind this is above our paygrade right now, but there is a library that all the bigwigs use (like Apple and React):

            https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing
            https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing/blob/master/src/index.js
            https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gre/bezier-easing/master/src/index.js

        We first need to create a bezier easing funtion

            let ease = BezierEasing(a,b,c,d);
        
        And then we call it with the delta:

            ease(delta)

        This is essentially the same as:

            BezierEasing(a,b,c,d)(delta);

        If you create a function that returns a function for each argument, [e.g. func(a)(b)(c) ], this technique is called "currying."

    */

    /*

        But what about animations that we want to happen in sequence?

        Do we use setTimeout() a bunch of times?

        We need to use Promises.

        A function that uses a Promise, instead of returning an immediate value, it returns a Promise object that can resolve into a value in the future.

        Promises used to be very messy in earlier versions of JavaScript, but nowadays we are able to use the keyword

            await

        Which "pauses" execution of the program, until a Promise resolves before moving on to the next line of code.

        In fact, here's a pause function implemented with a Promise:

    */

    function pause(ms) {

        return new Promise( (resolve,reject) => {
            
            setTimeout(resolve,ms);

        } );

    }

    /*

        We can use the returned Promise like this:

            pause(3000).then( () => console.log("Done!") );

        *or* more modernly

            await pause(3000);
            console.log("Done!");

        However we can only use the await keyword in a function that has been declared to be asynchronous
    */
            async function wait3Seconds() {
                await pause(3000);
                console.log("Done!");
            }
    /*
        Awaits can also be used to evaluate return values

            let theAnswer = await hugeCalculation();


        So let's re-do our Animation object so that it's asynchronous.

        All we need to do is wrap our code in a Promise, and resolve() instead of return.

        Then we can chain animations with .then() or inside an async function we can await them.

        And we can loop chains of animations by creating asynchronous functions that call themselves at the end.

        So here's what you're going to need to do:

        1) Use the animations we've built to spiffy up your tank (your option)

        2) Extend the animation system so that it handles:
            - scale
            - rotation/angle
            - tint
            - alpha

        3) Make one of your fish:
            - idly bob around, 
            - when clicked/tapped, swim up to the surface, 
            - swim back down, and 
            - resume idly bobbing

        4) Make another one of your fish swim over to where you "tap on the glass" before heading back to their idle state.
